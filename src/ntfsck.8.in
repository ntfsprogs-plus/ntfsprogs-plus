.SH NAME
ntfsck \- check and repair a Linux ntfs filesystem.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfsck
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.I \fIdevice\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntfsck
is used to check the ntfs filesystem in linux. It will repair corrupted ntfs filesystem.
.B ntfsck
do not support journal replay. Windows ntfs filesystem and some commercial linux ntfs
filesystem use journal. But there's no open-source ntfs filesystem to support journaling.
So if you have storage which have journal data, it's better to repair in Windows.

When the system has been shutdonw suddenly on linux, filesystem should be marked as dirty normally.
Because linux ntfs filesystem does not support journaling, fsck should scan all disk
for checking and repairing.
.B ntfsck
can be useful utility to check and repair ntfs filesystem in linux.

.I device
is a block device (e.g., /dev/sdc1) or file containing the ntfs filesystem.
If \fIdevice\fR is mounted, then ntfsck will not be executed because it is not safe to run
on mounted filesystem.

If
.B ntfsck
is run in interactive mode, it will ask the user to fix each problem found in the filesystem.
If you specify '-r' or not specify any option, ntfsck will execute with interactive mode.
At that time, you should not specify -a/-p, -y, -C, -n option, because those options are
mutually exclusive. (meaning that above options should be specified by just only one option)
Meaning of -a/-p, -y, -n options is same as other fsck utilities's execpt -C option.
-C option will exit after only checking device is dirty or not.
It returns 0, if device is clean. return 1 if device is dirty.

And,
.B ntfsck
will set clusters bitmap which is allocated to repairable inode even no-repair mode
to prevent cluster duplication during fsck, or filesystem operations after mount
without finishing checking filesystem.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-repair\-auto
Auto repair mode. This option does the same thing as the
.B \-p
option. It is provided for backwards compatibility only; it is suggested that people use
.B \-p
option if possible.
This option should not be specified at the same time with \-y, \-n, \-C options.
.TP
.B \-C
Check only mode. Check if device volume is dirty or not.
This option should not be specified at the same time with \-a/\-p, \-y, \-n options.
.B ntfsck
return zero, if device is clean, else return 1. (meaning that volume is dirty)
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-repair\-no
No repair mode. Open the filesystem read-only. This mode just check only problem of filesystem.
And answer 'no' to all question. Even this mode,
.B ntfsck
will set cluster bitmap for all repairable candidate inode to prevent cluster duplication.
This option should not be specified at the same time with \-a/\-p, \-y, \-C options.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Do not print progress percent.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-repair
Interactive mode. Check and repair interactively. Now do not support 'yestoall' or 'notoall'.
So you should input 'Y' or 'N' for all question for problem.
.TP
.B \-p
Preen repair mode.
.B ntfsck
will fix any filesystem problems automatically without human intervention.
Generally, fsck will try to fix automatically as possible. When it found a problem
which require human interaction, fsck print problem and ask input from human.
But now this option is same as \-y in
.B ntfsck.

.TP
.B \-y, \-\-repair\-yes
Yes repair mode. Assume an answer of 'yes' to all questions.
This option should not be specified at the same time with \-a/\-p, \-n, \-C options.
.TP
.B \-y \-\-verbose

.TP
.B \-V \-\-version
Print
.B ntfsck
version.

.SH EXIT CODES
All exit codes returned by
.B ntfsck
are listed below:
.br
\	0\	\-\ No errors
.br
\	1\	\-\ Filesystem errors corrected
.br
\	2\	\-\ Filesystem errors corrected, need to reboot
.br
\	4\	\-\ Filesystem errors left uncorrected
.br
\	8\	\-\ Operational error
.br
\	16\	\-\ Usage or syntax error
.br
\	32\	\-\ Canceled by user interrupt
.br
\	64\	\-\ Not supported filesystem
.br
\	128\	\-\ Shared library error

.SH BUG REPORTS
If you found a problem which
.B ntfsck
cannot repair filesystem, then you may dump disk image using ntfsclone
and send it to above github homepage for debugging.
Sample of dumping image using ntfsclone:
.RS
.sp
.B ntfsclone -o <target image name> -f -m --ignore-fs-check <device>
.sp

You can also refer ntfsclone(8) to know further information.
